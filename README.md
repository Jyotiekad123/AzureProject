Tackle the causes and consequences of systemic vulnerability
The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated vulnerabilities related to the social determinants of health. Some of the groups at greatest risk from the virus are also the hardest to reach, with complex and evolving eligibility requirements representing a barrier that perpetuates healthcare inequity.
Convene and participate in broad coalitions with a bias for action
We are working with an external coalition convened by MITRE, the coalition of coalitions represented by The Fight Is In Us, and government, in addition to our internal partnership with Bing.
Contribute a “resilience toolbox” of open tools and technologies
Our Covid-19 eligibility bot, and reference implementation for similar bots, is available open-source on GitHub at microsoft/covid-vaccine-bot and deployed live at thefightisinus.org.
Understand the links between people, practices, and outcomes
We have observed the practice of decentralized policy communication creating adverse outcomes for groups who are unable to access, interpret, and act on the policy information that is relevant to them, i.e., to determine eligibility and schedule and receive a complete course of vaccination.
Democratize expert workflows and real-world evidence development
Covid-19 is everyone’s concern, but there are not enough experts to answer everyone’s questions directly. Bots help to scale experts by absorbing the overhead of policy implementation. In many cases, the real-world actions taken by the users of bots contribute to real-world sources of evidence.
Build trust through transparency and value-sensitive design
We are conservative about the information captured by the bot and communicate the rationale in a clear and concise privacy statement at the initiation of each conversation. The sequence of questions aims to minimize the number of simple Yes/No answers to an eligibility determination.
Design for transformation at the mesoscale of activity
Our goal is not just to create a Vaccine Eligibility Bot for Covid-19 in the US, but to create a framework for use at other vaccine stages, in other counties, and for other pandemics and large-scale emergencies in general. We want to help bots become a standard part of the toolbox with which organizations coordinate and communicate information to the communities that they serve.
