Tackle the causes and consequences of systemic vulnerability
The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated vulnerabilities related to the social determinants of health. Some of the groups at greatest risk from the virus are also the hardest to reach, with complex and evolving eligibility requirements representing a barrier that perpetuates healthcare inequity.
Convene and participate in broad coalitions with a bias for action
We are working with an external coalition convened by MITRE, the coalition of coalitions represented by The Fight Is In Us, and government, in addition to our internal partnership with Bing.
Contribute a “resilience toolbox” of open tools and technologies
Our Covid-19 eligibility bot, and reference implementation for similar bots, is available open-source on GitHub at microsoft/covid-vaccine-bot and deployed live at thefightisinus.org.
Understand the links between people, practices, and outcomes
We have observed the practice of decentralized policy communication creating adverse outcomes for groups who are unable to access, interpret, and act on the policy information that is relevant to them, i.e., to determine eligibility and schedule and receive a complete course of vaccination.
Democratize expert workflows and real-world evidence development
Covid-19 is everyone’s concern, but there are not enough experts to answer everyone’s questions directly. Bots help to scale experts by absorbing the overhead of policy implementation. In many cases, the real-world actions taken by the users of bots contribute to real-world sources of evidence.
Build trust through transparency and value-sensitive design
We are conservative about the information captured by the bot and communicate the rationale in a clear and concise privacy statement at the initiation of each conversation. The sequence of questions aims to minimize the number of simple Yes/No answers to an eligibility determination.
Design for transformation at the mesoscale of activity
Our goal is not just to create a Vaccine Eligibility Bot for Covid-19 in the US, but to create a framework for use at other vaccine stages, in other counties, and for other pandemics and large-scale emergencies in general. We want to help bots become a standard part of the toolbox with which organizations coordinate and communicate information to the communities that they serve.


As Covid-19 vaccine rollouts began in January 2021, it became clear that the phased eligibility approach in use by the United States was causing widespread confusion. The question of eligibility has been a complex topic, with rules and qualifications differing state-by-state – and sometimes differing at county and city levels. In states like Arizona and Massachusetts, we observed eligibility differences from county to county. In Los Angeles and Chicago, eligibility criteria were different between large cities and their surrounding counties. In North Dakota, the vaccine eligibility criteria even varied between pharmacies and vaccinating locations.

Because of the technical complexity in navigating this information space, there is a healthcare equity concern as to the ability of different groups to access vaccination resources. Qualifying individuals in hard-hit communities are underserved compared to the well-connected and technically savvy. This is often due to a gap between the information that exists and the ability of people to access it – on their own terms, in a form they understand, and in their own language.

Our goal with this project was to create a conversational chatbot to streamline the determination of vaccine eligibility in the United States, aggregating policies across regions and policy updates over time. Users would interact with the bot via a simple workflow of Yes or No questions to determine their current eligibility and be directed towards authoritative sources for confirmation. We designed this bot to be accessible across a range of communication channels (e.g., web, SMS, and WhatsApp), with localizations available for communities that may otherwise be disadvantaged due to low levels of English proficiency.

Azure Health Bot empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experiences at scale. It combines a built-in medical database with natural language capabilities to understand clinical terminology and can be easily customized to support your organization's clinical and operational use cases. The service enables customers’ compliance with industry requirements including HIPAA.

As a native Azure service, Azure Health Bot benefits from the Azure’s security investments as well as the most comprehensive compliance coverage of any cloud service provider. Now customers can use standard Azure management tools that you are familiar with and rely on the 99.9% SLA commitment. While currently available in 2 regions (East US and West Europe), it will expand availability to 8 regions over the coming months.
